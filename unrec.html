          <summary><strong class="badrev">Counter Strike: Global Offensive</strong><br>It might be fun to play once you get the skills to know the maps, guns, and prices but itâ€™s so difficult to get to that point</summary>

        <li><details>
          <summary><strong class="badrev">Team Fortress 2</strong><br>Similarly to the one above, might be fun with the skills to know the weapons and how they work but I have put a good 1,200+ hours into this game and I had not figured most stuff out during that time. And I still to this day do not know how to play very well.</summary>

        </details></li>
        <li><details>
          <summary><strong class="badrev">World of Tanks</strong><br>Again, as with the two above, might be fun when you learn things like maps and reload times and other things like that but i have put a very good amount of time into this game and ive heard people saying how easy it is to move up the tiers in this game however through the multiple years that ive played this game i have managed to get up to tier 6 of 10 and even then this is recent news. </summary>
